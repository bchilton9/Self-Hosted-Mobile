# 📱 Self-Hosted Better Mobile

A lightweight customization project that improves mobile usability across self-hosted apps.

This project enhances user interfaces that are clunky or difficult on small screens. By injecting a single JavaScript file, it transforms mobile layouts into clean, tap-friendly experiences. Works alongside **Theme Park** for styling, but focuses entirely on **functionality improvements**, not themes.

___

## 📲 Features

- Custom mobile launcher for Organizr (like iOS app icons)
- Full-screen card with collapsible categories and touch-friendly buttons
- Automatically pulls tab data from Organizr’s existing config
- Hamburger toggle replaces the sidebar on mobile
- Can be injected using a simple script tag — no install or rebuild needed

## 🚀 How to Use with Organizr

### 1. Add the JavaScript to Organizr

In Organizr:
- Go to **Settings** → **Customization** → **Custom JavaScript**
- Paste the following:
```
    (function(){
      const script = document.createElement(‘script’);
      script.src = “https://mobile.chilsoft.com/organizr/main.js”;
      script.type = “text/javascript”;
      document.head.appendChild(script);
    })();
```
Save, then reload the page on a mobile device to see the new launcher.

> 💡 Want to customize the look too? This works great with [Theme Park](https://theme-park.dev/) — just use their guide to apply a CSS theme. Our script won’t interfere.

___

## ✨ Goals

- Make mobile-first enhancements for self-hosted dashboards
- Keep everything client-side (injected, not installed)
- Fix UI the original devs didn’t optimize for touchscreens 😎
