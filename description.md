<strong>Self-Hosted Mobile</strong> improves mobile usability across a growing collection of self-hosted apps. Designed for touchscreens, it adds features like app-style launchers, collapsible categories, and cleaner layouts — all injected with a single line of JavaScript. Works alongside Theme Park themes but focuses purely on fixing bad mobile UI. Simple, lightweight, and constantly expanding.
